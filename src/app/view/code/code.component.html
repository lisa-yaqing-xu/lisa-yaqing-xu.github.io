      Animated Poseur
    </a>
    <p>
      Animated Poseur is a frame animation-focused drawing application. It's currently an on-going project,
      though it started off as my senior thesis. Currently it has simple drawing functions that include brush,
      rectangular selection, eraser, fill, and shapes, but has an animation state and frame management system
      as well as layers. Animated Poseur offers a .png + JSON sprite sheet export support.
    </p>
    <p>
      Animated Poseur is currently built on the AngularJS framework on the front end and JavaEE back end on
      Google App Engine. However, future plans for the app include migrating it to Angular 2+, with a Spring Boot back
      end.

      Piggy Bank Polymer Components
    </a>
    <a href="https://github.com/lisa-yaqing-xu/PiggyBankComponents"><span class="github-logo"></span></a>
    <p>
      This is an example of a resource management tool we began to build.
      It leveraged an existing time tracking solution that we implemented previously to
      pull in the hours recorded by each resource. It was our intent to perform some
      calculations with the data collected by PiggyBank and the other platform to enable financial
      reports to be created. The reports would have included organizational
      performance against quarterly and annual budget targets, as well as resource utilization metrics.
    </p>
    <p>
      PiggyBank is built using the Google Polymer framework. The charts were built using D3.js.

    <h3>OverCoat: An Implicit Canvas for 3D Painting</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/lisa-yaqing-xu/Overcoat"><span class="github-logo"></span></a>
    <p>
      For a graphics course in grad school I implemented a part of
      <a href="http://zurich.disneyresearch.com/OverCoat/">this paper</a>. I was a bit short on time given the circumstances
      of the semester, but I was able to get a lot of the core functionality working. Overall a cool project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Written in C++ using the OpenGL library, which I was not familiar with at the time. Definitely a learning experience.

    <h3>Texture-Consistent Shadow Removal</h3>
    <a href="https://github.com/lisa-yaqing-xu/ShadowRemoval"><span class="github-logo"></span></a>
    <p>
      An implementation of <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~fliu/papers/eccv08.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>
      for my graduate computer vision course, although somewhat limited due to time constraints. Using the methodology
      detailed in the paper (full pdf report on what I did in Github) I was able to mostly achieve texture-consistent shadow
      removal.

    <p>
      Written in Matlab. Very much not for production use.
